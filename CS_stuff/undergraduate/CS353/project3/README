In order to test this program, I made some change in makefile.

To test my program, you can simply compile everything that is needed.
make
make run
make sample2

After compile all the files, just type ./run <files need to debug> in the command line.
For example "./run sample2"

Also, in chess.cpp, you can uncomment "#define DEBUG 1", then when you run the program, it will show all the actions. When thread get created, when context switch happened and some other actions.
