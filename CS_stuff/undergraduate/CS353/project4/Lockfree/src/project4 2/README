My program works as follows:
PseudoRandom.java ReentrantLockPseudoRandom.java NonBlockingPseudoRandom.java TestDriver.java -> TestDriver
I create two sets of instances of generator, one is locking version and the other is non-blocking version
Then I ran them by 10 threads respectively, record the total number that generated by each of them.
The result will be print out to stdout after about 8 seconds.
To test this part, just do "java TestDriver" in command line.

For the part 4, I only implemented the Lock-free stack. I am sorry that I did not provide any test for this part. The code is short and straight forward though.
File Node.java and Stack.java is for this part.
