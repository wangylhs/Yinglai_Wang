In order to test this program, I made some change in makefile.

To test my program, you can simply compile everything that is needed.
make chess.so
make runner
make sample2

After compile all the files, just type "mpirun -np 51 runner" in the command line.
Since I used "system()" method in runner.c. The test program's name is fixed.
So, if other test is needed, please change the test file's name to sample2.c, then complie using make sample2, then run the mpirun command as above.
The program will give a crash report if any schedule crashed after all processes finished.
