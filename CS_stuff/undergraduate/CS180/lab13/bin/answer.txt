a. The equals() method take a Child object as parameter and print "Inside of
   Child.equals", then return false.

b. I think the output will be:
	0
	1
	2
	3
	Inside of Child.equals
	4

c. The call to the equals() method prints to the console because when an
   object of Child class call the method and pass the Child object as a
   parameter, the equals() method in Child class is called, not the method in
   Object class. Then it prints to the console.
