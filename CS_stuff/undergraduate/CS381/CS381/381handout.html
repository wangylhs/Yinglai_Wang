Prerequisite:

        The lectures will assume students know the prerequisite material (of particular importance
        is the CS 251 material) 

Objective:

        The goal of the course is to provide the students with a knowledge of the techniques used 
        for analyzing the time and space requirements of algorithms, and the application of these 
        techniques to the design of efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, pattern-matching, 
        graph problems, and other selected problems. The course also provides a brief introduction 
        to the theory of intractability.

Course Work:

        Homework sets  20% (the first homework will be posted in week 1, and 
        homeworks are generally due 3 lectures after posting -- so you have 
        approximately 1 week + 1 lecture to complete a homework; I usually post 
        homework N+1 and the solution to homework N after homework N has been turned in)

	Two in-class exams 15%  (7.5% each, days TBA -- roughly halfway between the midterm and the beginning or end of semester)

        Evening midterm exam  30%   Evening exam on Oct 16 - 8-10pm in EE 170

        Final exam  35%  (Comprehensive)

	All exams are closed book, closed notes, without electronic devices of any kind (including calculators)

Homework and Exam policy:

        Homeworks are due in hard copy (not by email), at the beginning
        of the lecture.  Late homeworks will not be accepted.

        Missing a quiz or an exam implies a grade of zero in it,
	unless there is a proper reason (e.g., medical).  Examples 
	of non-valid reasons include oversleeping, forgetting, 
	discretionary travel (travel whose timing is under your control, 
	such as an interview trip), and a host of others.  Such policy 
	precedents are difficult for an instructor to deviate from 
	without running the risk of being accused of "treating people 
	unequally" ...etc, so I hope none of you will put me in that situation.
	If there is a proper excuse for missing an exam, then I will give a
	make-up that has the same level of difficulty but I may use
        a different format from the missed exam, e.g., it may be an oral
	exam using a whiteboard so I can watch how you develop your solutions. 
        I have never given the same missed exam as makeup in the past.
