<H3> List of topics to be covered in class </H3>

<PRE>

Framework for analysis of algorithms, rate of growth of functions
("big oh" notation, etc), review of proofs by induction, summations,
recurrences and how to solve them.  Worst-case vs average case
analysis.

Divide and conquer paradigm (mergesorting as an example).

An important general recurrence (of which the recurrence 
for mergesort is a special case).

Linear-time selection (randomized, deterministic).

Pointwise max computation, and the min thereof [ See posted PDF ]

Application of selection to majority and its generalization to k occurrences [ in hwk 1 ]

Dynamic programming paradigm: Solution to matrix chain multiplication problem 

Largest square block of 1s in a Boolean matrix [ See posted PDF ]

Maximum-sum contiguious subarray [ See posted PDF ]

Longest common subsequence and its generalization to string edit

Greedy algorithms
  Activity selection 
  Matching (approximation) 

Plane sweep paradigm:  
	Maximal points in two dimensions (points not
		dominated by any other point from the input set)
	Longest Increasing Subsequence 
		[ See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence
		  or use google (it's a famous problem so there is much information
		  about it on the web) ] 
	Intersection detection for line segments

Proximity problems: Algorithms for closest pair of two-dimensional points 

Convex hull 

Lower bounds: Information-theoretic, Adversary-based
Examples of lower bounds:  For searching, sorting, min, min and max, 
element uniqueness (without proof), set equality (without proof). 
Lower bound proofs by reduction (convex hull, closest pair, set 
intersection).

Graph algorithms: Review of Depth-first search, connected components, Breadth-first search

Applications of depth-first search: Bridges, articulation points, biconnectivity 
	[ See www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/451/bc.ps ]

Strongly connected components

Topological sorting 

Review of Kruskal's algo for min spanning tree (MST)
Application of MST to approximate Euclidean TSP

Review of Dijkstra's algo for single-source shortest paths

All-pairs path problems (dynamic prog solution)

Maximum matching, network flow
	(just problem def and time complexity)

Applications of network flow to disjoint-path problems

Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern matching algorithm 
Examples of use of pattern matching

Data structures:
[ Assume known from CS 251: Balanced tree data structures ]
Review 2-3 trees (search, insert, delete, split, concatenate) 
	(Chapter 18, the B+ tree where the allowed degrees are 2 and 3) 
How to augment tree structures 
	(Chap 14 explains this for red-black trees but the ideas work for other trees)
Range queries for d > 1.  See, e.g., 
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_tree
	http://cbcb.umd.edu/~carlk/bioinfo-lectures/rangetrees.pdf
Multisearch structures  [ See posted PDF ]
Union-find  

P, NP, NP-completeness, NP-hardness, polynomial-time reductions.

Approximation algorithms 

******** No time to cover the material below this line ********

Basic number-theoretic algorithms [as time allows]
      Extended Euclid algo, exponentiation algo  

Parallelism [as time allows]
