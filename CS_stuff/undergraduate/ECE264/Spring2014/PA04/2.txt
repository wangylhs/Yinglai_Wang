Usage: grep-lite [OPTION]... PATTERN
Search for PATTERN in standard input. PATTERN is a
string. grep-lite will search standard input line by
line, and (by default) print out those lines which
contain pattern as a substring.

  -v, --invert-match     select non-matching lines
  -n, --line-number      print line numbers with output
  -q, --quiet            suppress all output

Exit status is 0 if any line is selected, 1 otherwise;
if any error occurs, then the exit status is 2.
