   Message is:
   Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
   I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size
   But when I start to tell them,
   They think I'm telling lies.
   I say,
   It's in the reach of my arms
   The span of my hips,
   The stride of my step,
   The curl of my lips.
   I'm a woman
   Phenomenally.
   Phenomenal woman,
   That's me.
   
   I walk into a room
   Just as cool as you please,
   And to a man,
   The fellows stand or
   Fall down on their knees.
   Then they swarm around me,
   A hive of honey bees.
   I say,
   It's the fire in my eyes,
   And the flash of my teeth,
   The swing in my waist,
   And the joy in my feet.
   I'm a woman
   Phenomenally.
   Phenomenal woman,
   That's me.
   
   Men themselves have wondered
   What they see in me.
   They try so much
   But they can't touch
   My inner mystery.
   When I try to show them
   They say they still can't see.
   I say,
   It's in the arch of my back,
   The sun of my smile,
   The ride of my breasts,
   The grace of my style.
   I'm a woman
   
   Phenomenally.
   Phenomenal woman,
   That's me.
   
   Now you understand
   Just why my head's not bowed.
   I don't shout or jump about
   Or have to talk real loud.
   When you see me passing
   It ought to make you proud.
   I say,
   It's in the click of my heels,
   The bend of my hair,
   the palm of my hand,
   The need of my care,
   'Cause I'm a woman
   Phenomenally.
   Phenomenal woman,
   That's me.
Pass.
