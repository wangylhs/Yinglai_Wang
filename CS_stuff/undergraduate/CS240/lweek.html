<H2>
More general traversals: depth-first and breadth-first
</H2>


When you have a graph (note: a tree is a graph without cycles) you can traverse
it systematically: breadth-first search and depth-first search
<P>

<H2>
Computing a histogram using a 1-D array
</H2>

Example: If you have a set of numbers, a "histogram" gives you a count of the number of numbers of each type. It's also called a "frequency distribution".
<P>

<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rego/cs240/lectures/w7-ex/hist.html"> Computing a histogram using a 1D array </a>
<P>


TRY THIS as a homework exercise: Suppose you want to print out graphically what the histogram looks like. Add to the piece of code, using the char ** pointer provided in the code. Make a 2D array of the required size and fill it with 'x's and blanks. If the histogram says there are 8 numbers with value 3, your diagram should show a column of
8 'x's for value 3.
<P>

<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rego/cs240/lectures/w11-ex/hist.html"> Your exercise is to 
graph the histogram (so try it first on your own) </a>
<P>

<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rego/cs240/lectures/w11-ex/flip.html"> REPEAT M times: toss a coin N times, build histogram of the number of occurrence for "heads" </a>
<P>

<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/rego/cs240/lectures/w11-ex/flip-out.html"> histogram for coin-tossing: it's a NORMAL APPROXIMATION! </a>

<H2>
The Josephus problem
</H2>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem"> Background </a>
<P>

<b><xmp>
The is an example of an algorithm to elect a leader (say, in a system of distributed processors).
</xmp></b>


We use a circular one-directional N node linked-list: each node represents a person who stands in a circle. We start counting at node 1 and always delete the M-th node. Last one standing after (N-1) deletions is the "winner".
