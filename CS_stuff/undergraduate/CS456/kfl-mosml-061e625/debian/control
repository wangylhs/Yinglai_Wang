Description: light-weight implementation of Standard ML (SML).
 Moscow ML:
   * implements the full Standard ML language, as revised 1997,
     including Modules and some extensions
   * yet is backwards compatible with Moscow ML versions prior to 2.00
   * implements large parts of the new SML Basis Library
   * implements separate compilation
   * can produce compact stand-alone executables (a la Caml Light)
   * supports quotations and antiquotations, useful for metaprogramming
