My program works like follows:

lunch vpnunneld and vpntunnel first(you can lunch mobilereminderd first if you want)

./mobilereminder <reminder-file> <port-number> <secret-key>

./vpntunneld <vpn-port-number>
once it got the message from vpntunnel, it will sendback an ACK along with the second-port-number

./vpntunnel <vpn-IP> <vpn-port-number> <server-IP> <server-port-number>
this program will get the second-port-number and show it on the console.
It will also show what IP(server IP) and port number(second-port-number) should user use to lunch mobilereminder

./mobilereminder <server-IP> <second-port-number> <secret-key>





vpntunneld will forward the messag to the server, if secret-key matches, server will send the reminder information to vpntunneld. The vpntunneld will forward the reminder information back to mobilereminder.
