1.	Maximum 32 semaphores
2.	Maximum 64 locks
3.	Semaphore is created by using SemCreate() function.
	Number of semaphores are passed as an argument to this function.
	It returns a handle to this semaphore.
4.	SemWait() decrements by one value of the semaphore. The semaphore will be decremented
	when its value is greater than zero. If the value is zero, then the current process 
	will block untile semaphore's value becomes greater than zero.
	SemSignal() increments the semaphore's value by one. Then check if there is a process 
	to wake up.
5.	A handle is a pointer to a semaphore, different processes can access the same semaphore 
	through a handle.
